The **DarkLight Cover/Calibrator (DLC)** is a DIY project to build a motorized telescope cover, flat panel, or a combined flip-flat system. Designed for versatility and modularity, the DLC supports a variety of setups:

- **Light Panel Only** ‚Äì Wall-mounted calibration panel (no servo)  
- **Servo(s) Cover Only** ‚Äì Flip cover for sky flats and darks  
- **Flip-Flat Combo** ‚Äì Integrated servo and light panel system

The DLC is compatible with both **ASCOM** and **INDI** platforms, enabling seamless automation through:

- The **DLC Windows app** (ASCOM only)
- ASCOM automation software (via the **ICoverCalibrator** driver)
- The **INDI** platform for Linux/macOS users

Optional **dew heating** reduces the need for additional equipment and cabling.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è While the DLC **does NOT** make the telescope weatherproof or dustproof, it provides hands-off control and dark/light calibration for astrophotography in the field or an observatory.
