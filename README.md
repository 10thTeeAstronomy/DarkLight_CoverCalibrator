The **DarkLight Cover/Calibrator (DLC)** is a DIY project to build a motorized telescope cover, flat panel, or a combined flip-flat system. Designed for versatility and modularity, the DLC supports a variety of setups:

- **Light Panel Only** – 12V wall-mounted calibration panel (no servo)  
- **Servo Cover Only** – Flip cover for sky flats or darks  
- **Flip-Flat Combo** – Integrated servo and light panel system

Optional **dew heating** reduces the need for additional equipment and cabling. The DLC is compatible with both **ASCOM** and **INDI** platforms, enabling seamless automation through:

- The **DLC Windows app** (ASCOM only)
- ASCOM automation software (via the **ICoverCalibrator** driver)
- The **INDI** platform for Linux/macOS users

> ⚠️ **Note:** The DLC does **not** make the telescope weatherproof or dustproof. It is intended for use in controlled environments (e.g., observatories or supervised field use).
